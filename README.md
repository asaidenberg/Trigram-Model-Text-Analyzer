# Trigram-Model-Text-Analyzer
TextAnalyzer is a trigram-based language model that processes text corpora to estimate probabilities, compute perplexity, and classify essays using statistical methods. This project enables text analysis through n-gram models and provides insights into language patterns.

Features
Reads a corpus and constructs unigram, bigram, and trigram counts.
Computes raw and smoothed probabilities for trigrams.
Generates sentence probability scores.
Calculates perplexity of a given test corpus.
Implements an essay scoring experiment to classify test essays based on trained models.
